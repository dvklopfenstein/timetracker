You can use it to swiftly create, report, analyze, and plot time units. Time is stored in pandas-friendly human-readable plain-text CSV files.

Proton is a \"privacy by default\" encrypted suite of tools, including email, that over 100 million people use to stay private and secure online. Comma-separated files contain tables (rows and columns) of data and can be opened using popular editors such as vim, emacs, or notepad++. They can also be opened Excel. Tags To analyze groups of time entries later, trk includes support for tags, which are stored in their own column in the CSV files. You can find and filter entries by using tags along with other search conditions using pandas. Tags are stored in the last column of the trk CSV files. Multiple tags are separated by the ; character. Activities Each CSV files contains a column that can optionally contain an activity. Activities can streamline analyzing and plotting groups of time slots. Support for multiple projects trk supports multiple projects. Each project can be maintained as a git -managed repo (repository).

For a list of timetracker-csv commands, enter trk --help . Projects Timetracker-csv works seemlessly with projects that are version-managed with git . But it also works with any project. If you use git , then each git-managed project repository (repo) will also be a trk-managed project. This means that time will be saved in separate CSV files for separate repos. Multiple CSV files can be combined into a single CSV file using the trk export command. CSV files Comma-separated value ( CSV ) files store tabular data in plain text. CSV files are readable by both humans and computers. CSV rows and columns Each time unit is stored in a single row. Each row contains five columns: Name Required Example Start time required 9am Monday, March 31, 2025 Duration required 2 hours Activity optional \"documenting\" or \"coding\" Description required Made decorative almond tree blossoms out of gold Tags optional grant=ABC, grant=XYZ, art, metalwork Start time : Determined automatically upon running trk start The --last option can be used with trk start to automatically start the timer one second after the previous time unit ended. This is useful when you want to continue tracking time seamlessly without any gaps between sessions. Example: $ trk start --last Duration : Calculated automatically upon running trk stop -m msg Activity : There can be one activity per time unit. Description : Just as a git commit message is mandatory, so is a trk stop message, which describes the work that was done in the time unit. Tags : There can be any number of tags per time unit. Tags can be of the form key=value or simply value . CSV files for a single project There is one CSV file written per user per project. Therefore, a single project repository will have more than one CSV file if there is more than one person working on the project. Having one project CSV file per person (username) prevents conflicts when using git to commit timetracking csv files. People commonly use pandas to analyze and plot data contained in CSV files. Multiple CSV files can be combined into a single CSV file using the trk export command.
